In my personal opinion i belive tik tok could deal with there privicy breach issues by proving to the USA goverment that they are not part of of the commies. this still impacts how the goverment takes conrol of us and while there was many isues with tik tok a commie security breach was not one of them. i whould implment a policy of no interface among ther apps by tik tok as it is allowed by iphone users. The lesson from this is not to brech atr all
