In my personal opinion i belive tik tok could deal with there privicy breach issues by proving to the USA goverment that they are not part of of the commies. this still impacts how the goverment takes conrol of us and while there was many isues with tik tok a commie security breach was not one of them. i whould implment a policy of no interface among ther apps by tik tok as it is allowed by iphone users. The lesson from this is not to brech atr all

Platforms that facilitate communication, collaboration, and efficiency help connect up employees from across the generation divide.the use of slang can undermine the perceived professionalism of the speaker or writer.

i belive technology has made a great improvement to how we play sports, still it has many negatives nad has caused many anger among fans and contesenta for sports world wide. It is the cause of loss of worold champions and there injuries as withh better tech advsncments in shoes and courts older players that are not used too playing like that are loosing there magic. And the main issue uis the implimentation of ai. many will agree with me it is quite ovious ai predicting the outcomes of games causes lots of gambling adictions people loosing intrest and more.

 Aditionally there is poes to the use of ai. pros like reaching a wider audience thru ai advertisments on social medias, and postivily impacting how we watch games with sientific informsation as we watch.

  I believe that the most useful feature of an AI tutor for me would be its ability to create a customized study schedule that balances my coursework and test preparation. This feature would help me stay organized and ensure that I allocate sufficient time to each subject, reducing the stress that often accompanies exam preparation.

he bans on student cell phone use and social media access in Florida schools can be seen as both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the perspective taken. On one hand, proponents argue that these measures can significantly reduce distractions in the classroom, allowing students to focus more on their studies and engage more meaningfully with their teachers and peers. By limiting access to social media, schools may also create a safer environment that mitigates the risks of cyberbullying and social anxiety, which can be exacerbated by constant online interactions. However, opponents raise valid concerns about the potential negative impact on student autonomy and the ability to communicate during emergencies. In a world where technology is integral to daily life.
